# toxic

Welcome to Toxic by [Sohoxic](https://github.com/Sohoxic/toxic), a simple and minimal static site generator which was primarily designed to help me easily document my life by keeping notes, learnings, thoughts all in one place instead of making static website for everything everytime, thus prioritising easy website building. This is the gardener of my digital garden(the initiator and the master to convert markdown files to static websites.).

For my fellow develops who wants to transform their lives in the similar way which I did, here's toxic for you to document your life, learnings etc. 

> Why Choose Toxic? 
> If your focus is more on content rather than configuration, then toxic is for you

## The Philosophy Behind Toxic

Toxic was created with three core principles in mind:

* **Simplicity**: No unnecessary complexity or bloat. You should be painlessly able to write `.md` files without having to worry about setting up and using your ssg.
* **Performance**: Ease of use should be the priority with faster processing and build times. We have parallel processing in place to take care of this
* **Aesthetics**: Tokyonight theme. I love this! If you don't you can always customise, toxic has given you all the flexibility

> Toxic does all of this, with style. Haha!

# StartHere - Interactive Personal Homepage

This is my personal homepage built with the toxic static site generator. It features:

- **Interactive Terminal**: Try commands like `whoami`, `ls`, `cd blog`, `cd proof-of-work`, `help`, `clear`, and `pwd`
- **Timeline**: A chronological overview of my journey and achievements
- **Social Links**: Connect with me on GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive design with hover effects and smooth animations

The terminal simulation allows you to navigate just like a real command line interface. You can:
- Use `cd blog` to navigate to my blog
- Use `cd proof-of-work` to scroll to the timeline section
- Use `ls` to see available "directories"
- Use `whoami` to learn more about me
- Use `help` to see all available commands

This page combines the interactivity of a React application with the simplicity and performance of a static site generator.

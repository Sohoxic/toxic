      - "I made my first contribution to the Distributed Query team, spent almost 13-14 hours a day for a week trying to read/learn everything about the Distributed query engine, revisiting concepts from Automata and getting used to Golang and our codebase, doing anything everything to make it happen."

This was everything I wanted, the only company I targetted to get in for more than a year, to explore systems specially distributed systems and the best thing that could happen was me working in a distributed database company. For any core systems guy, this is the dream place to be and to be very honest I couldn't imagine after I made it to the final round. Hands shivering, couldn't talk. The next morning I woke up not believing myself that I was placed."

# StartHere - Interactive Personal Homepage

This is my personal homepage built with the toxic static site generator. It features:

- **Interactive Terminal**: Try commands like `whoami`, `ls`, `cd blog`, `cd proof-of-work`, `help`, `clear`, and `pwd`
- **Timeline**: A chronological overview of my journey and achievements
- **Social Links**: Connect with me on GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive design with hover effects and smooth animations

The terminal simulation allows you to navigate just like a real command line interface. You can:
- Use `cd blog` to navigate to my blog
- Use `cd proof-of-work` to scroll to the timeline section
- Use `ls` to see available "directories"
- Use `whoami` to learn more about me
- Use `help` to see all available commands

This page combines the interactivity of a React application with the simplicity and performance of a static site generator.

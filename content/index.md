# Welcome to My Personal Site

This markdown content can be used if you want to include additional content below the main home page sections. The home template will render all the sections above based on the frontmatter variables, and any markdown content here will be available as `{{ content | safe }}` in the template if you choose to use it.

You can customize every aspect of the home page by modifying the frontmatter variables above:

- **Hero Section**: Change the title and subtitle
- **Social Links**: Update your social media URLs
- **Timeline**: Modify the timeline items, years, and achievements
- **Call-to-Action**: Customize the CTA section text and links

The template uses Jinja2's `default()` filter, so if you don't specify a variable, it will use sensible defaults.
